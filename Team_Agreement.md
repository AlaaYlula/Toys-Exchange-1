## Conflict Plan
When we need to resolve a conflict we will meet with the partner to handle this conflict. If one person is taking over the project we will discuss it together and solve the problem. Everyone will see what he/she can do based on their capability. In the mid-term project, we didn't have any conflicts al hamdullah.   

## Communication Plan
We are meeting every day from 10-2 am using team and zoom. We take breaks almost every 1 and half hours. And if we need to meet at night we meet at 9 pm. In case anyone has any issues we send messages on the Facebook group to plan meetings.
